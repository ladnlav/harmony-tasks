# Harmony Tasks

A task & project manager that lives **inside** Obsidian — in the spirit of Singularity and Todoist, with a fast, native UI on top of plain Markdown. Every task is a single Markdown note, so your data stays open, portable and future-proof, and there are **no plugin dependencies** and no account required.

Harmony Tasks is a fork of [BeautyTasks](https://github.com/avnibilgin/BeautyTasks) by Avni Bilgin. It adds **subprojects**, **checklists**, **project sections**, a **project overview** and **flexible recurrence** (“every Tuesday and Thursday”), and recurring tasks take their checklist and subtasks along. Moving over from BeautyTasks? See [below](#moving-over-from-beautytasks).

## Why Harmony Tasks

- **One note per task.** Each task is a normal Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Nothing is locked in a proprietary database — search it, edit it by hand, sync it, or version it with Git.
- **A real task app, natively.** A Todoist-inspired dashboard with sidebar navigation, a chip-based task editor, quick capture and keyboard-friendly flows — all rendered inside Obsidian, popout-window compatible.
- **Zero plugin dependencies, local-first.** No other plugin and no account required. Your tasks are plain Markdown in your vault — the one optional online feature is two-way **Google Calendar sync**, which stays off until you set it up.
- **Your frontmatter stays yours.** The two field names Harmony Tasks needs — `type` and `title` — are configurable, so it never has to claim a property you already use. Turning an existing note into a task adds frontmatter and nothing else; your text is never rewritten.
- **Fully themeable.** Every color is a CSS variable; works with your theme, CSS snippets, or the Style Settings plugin — including a monochrome mode.
- **10 languages.** The interface is available in English, German, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), French, Italian, Turkish, Russian, Simplified Chinese and Japanese (auto-detected from Obsidian, or set in settings). Natural-language **dates and times** work in all of them except Turkish, where English keywords (`tomorrow`, `next monday`) still do. English keywords work in every language, alongside your own.

## Features

### Views & navigation
A single dashboard with a left sidebar:

- **Inbox** — everything without a project.
- **Today** — tasks due today (plus anything overdue).
- **Upcoming** — a forward-looking, date-sorted agenda.
- **Recurring** — all repeating tasks at a glance.
- **Done** — completed tasks, with a built-in **Trash** for soft-deleted items.
- **Projects, Areas, Labels & Filters** — collapsible sections in the sidebar; open any project, area, label or saved filter as a **list, Kanban board or calendar**.
- **Search** — fast fuzzy search across all tasks; jump straight to a task and highlight it in place.
- **Manage** — a ListManager with separate **Projects**, **Areas**, **Labels** and **Filters** tabs: create, rename, recolor, hide, archive or delete each, and restore or permanently remove trashed items.

Every sidebar entry has a **right-click menu** (go to its note, edit, recolor, convert, hide, reorder, archive, delete), and you can **reorder** sections by drag or sort them **manually, by name or by task count**.

**Projects vs. Areas.** Organize tasks into **projects** or **areas** — two independent kinds, each with its own tab in the ListManager and its own `+` in the sidebar, so you can **create, archive and delete either one directly**. An **Area** is a fixed section that keeps its own place in the sidebar — ideal for long-running responsibilities that should never be “finished” — while a **project** is for work that eventually wraps up. You can convert one into the other at any time.

**Subprojects.** Projects and areas can hold **projects of their own** — one level deep, so a structure stays readable: *Area → Project*, or *Project → Subproject*. In the sidebar they sit indented under their parent, which gets a small arrow to fold them away (folded, its count includes theirs). The parent's page shows a **Subprojects** block with progress and what is overdue or due today for each one — click to open, drag a task onto one to move it there — and below it the parent's own tasks; the **overview** counts the whole branch. Create one with **Add subproject** in the parent's menu (or the *Belongs to* field when creating a project), move it with **Move to ▸** in its menu. Archiving a parent rests its subprojects with it; deleting a parent keeps them and moves them up to the top level.

**Sections & subsections.** Split a project or area into **sections** (and one level of **subsections**) — parts of the project, not tasks. Each section has a name, an optional **Markdown description** shown under its heading, its own tasks and its own **+ Add task**. Collapse a section, reorder or rename it from its **⋯ menu**, drag a task onto a section heading to move it there, or use **Move to section** in the task's context menu. The first section is created from the project's menu (or **+ Add section** at the end of the list). On the board, sections can be the columns (*Display → Group → Section*). Deleting a section moves its tasks up one level — or, if you tick the box, to the trash.

**Project overview.** Above the tasks of every project and area sits a collapsible **overview**: progress (*12/18 · 67 %*), counters for overdue, today, the next 7 days and undated tasks (click one to filter the page), the **next dates and deadlines**, and the **info & links** from the project note — rendered, with clickable links, and editable right there. Turn it off under *Settings → Overview on project pages*.

### Saved filters & smart views
Build custom queries — by project/area, label, priority, status, date range and more — and **save them to the sidebar** as reusable smart views, each with its own color. Per-view display options (layout, grouping, sorting, show completed) are remembered.

If a saved filter points at something you later deleted — a label, a project, a custom status — Harmony Tasks doesn't quietly return nothing. The affected dropdown is **outlined in red** and the entry is listed as *“… (missing)”*, so you can see the cause and remove it with one click.

### Three layouts: list, board or calendar

Every page — projects, areas, labels, saved filters, and Today / Upcoming / Inbox — can be shown in one of three ways. The choice is **remembered per page**, so a project can stay a board while Today stays a list.

**List** — the classic, with grouping (by date, deadline, priority, label, project or status), sorting, and optional completed tasks.

**Board** — a Kanban whose columns follow your **statuses** (fully customizable, see below):

- **Drag & drop** a card between columns to change its status instantly.
- **Group the board** by status, label, priority or project — not just status.
- **Reorder columns** by dragging their headers (saved per board), and add a task straight into a column with its `+`.
- Columns **stack vertically** on narrow panes and mobile, so the board stays usable on the phone.

**Calendar** — your tasks on a **year, month, week or day** grid, with a side panel for undated tasks. Drag a task onto a day to schedule it. In Today and Upcoming, your **Google events** can appear alongside them (read-only, see below).

Because columns map to the task's `status` field and days map to its date, moving a card or a task is just a normal edit to its Markdown note — nothing lives in a separate board file.

### Custom statuses
Define your own workflow beyond the built-in *To-Do · In progress · Done · Cancelled*. In *Settings → Statuses* you can **add, rename, reorder, recolor and change the icon** of statuses, grouped into three categories — **open · done · cancelled** — that drive behavior (completion timestamps, recurrence, trash). The in-progress state shows as a **half-filled checkbox** everywhere.

### Tasks & attributes
Each task can carry:

- **Status** — the built-in *To-Do · In progress · Done* (plus a *Cancelled* trash state), or your **own custom statuses**. Set one by **right-clicking** the checkbox (or **long-pressing** it on mobile), from the **status chip** in the task editor, or by dragging on the Kanban board — a left-click still simply completes the task.
- **Priority** (highest → lowest) with colored checkbox rings (P1/P2/P3).
- **Due date & time** and an optional **duration** (event length).
- A separate **deadline / scheduled** date & time. A task with only a deadline still shows up in Today and Upcoming when it comes due — one rule, no task hiding because you filled in the “wrong” date field. Deadlines are written as a countdown (*“in 3 days”*) and coloured by distance.
- **Project** and **Area** assignment.
- **Sub-tasks** — nest tasks under a parent, drawn with clean connector lines. Choose per view how they appear: compact (as progress on the parent), indented beneath it, or standing on their own.
- **Checklists** — lightweight check-off items inside a task (no separate notes, unlike sub-tasks). Add them in the task editor — even before the task exists — reorder by drag, paste several lines at once; lists and board cards show the progress (*☑ 2/5*), and a click on it lets you tick items without opening the task.
- **Labels** (`#tags`).
- **Recurrence** — “every day / week / 3 months …”, **specific weekdays** (“every Tuesday and Thursday”, weekdays, weekends), monthly by date or by weekday (“last Friday of the month”), with an optional end date or number of times — repeating from either the **due date** or the **completion date**. **Customize…** in the recurrence menu opens an editor with a preview of the next dates. When a recurring task is completed, the next occurrence keeps its **description, reminders, checklist (unticked) and fresh copies of its sub-tasks**, with their dates moved along; unfinished sub-tasks of the completed occurrence go to the trash.
- **Reminders** — get notified before or at a task’s time (see below).
- A **Markdown description**, a **timestamped comment log**, and **file/image attachments** (see below).

### Quick capture with natural language
Add tasks at the speed of thought. The quick-add modal understands plain sentences:

> `Write report tomorrow p1 #work`
> `Bericht schreiben morgen um 07:30 #arbeit`
> `Escribir informe mañana #importante`

**Dates and times** are understood in your interface language — English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese and Japanese. English keywords work everywhere, alongside your own, so `Escribir informe tomorrow` is fine too. Turkish has no date parser yet; there, English keywords are the way.

Everything else in the table below is the same in every language: **recurrence** is written in English, German or Russian (`every day`, `jeden Tag`, `каждый день`), and `p1`, `#label` and `@project` are symbols, not words.

Recognized tokens are stripped from the title automatically:

| What | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** | `today`, `tomorrow`, `day after tomorrow`, `in 3 days`, `next week`, `next monday`, a bare weekday (`friday`), `3 Jul` / `July 3rd`, `20.06.2026`, `06/20/2026`, `2026-06-20` |
| **Time** | `at 7:30`, `7:30`, `7pm`, `at 7`, `um 20.15`, `um 2015` (four digits and the dot form need `at`/`um` in front — otherwise `Sort photos from 2015` would become a time) |
| **Recurrence** | `every day`, `daily`, `every week`, `weekly`, `every 3 days`, `every 2 weeks`, `every 3 months`, `yearly`, `every monday and thursday`, `every 2 weeks on tue and thu`, `weekdays`, `last friday of the month`, `on the 15th of each month` — and in Russian `каждый вторник и четверг`, `по будням`, `раз в неделю`, `15 числа каждого месяца` |
| **Priority** | `p1`–`p4` or `!1`–`!4` |
| **Label** | `#work` — any label, created on the fly |
| **Project** | `@project` — existing projects and areas only |

A time or a recurrence without a date is anchored to **today**: a time needs a day to be shown and saved, and a recurrence without a date would never come back.

**Not recognized** (use the chips instead): reminders, duration, start date, status and parent.

#### When a word should stay text

Writing `Today's plan` and getting the word swallowed as a date is annoying. Two ways out — and both are the same thing under the hood:

- **Click the ✕ on the chip.** The recognized value goes away, the word returns to the title. This is the easy path; you don't need to know any syntax.
- **Type it yourself.** `\word` protects a single word — the same backslash escape Markdown uses, and the backslash disappears from the title. `"a whole phrase"` protects several words at once; the quotation marks stay, because they're your punctuation, not syntax.

```
\Today I go swimming      → title "Today I go swimming", no date
Book "Der Prozess" today  → title kept as typed, due today
every \monday standup     → title "every monday standup", no recurrence
```

The ✕ simply writes that backslash for you: `Dentist tomorrow` → ✕ → `Dentist \tomorrow`. Because the escape lives in the text, it survives — and typing a new date word afterwards is recognized again.

Prefer full control? Open the Todoist-style task editor with its chip row for date, priority, labels, recurrence, deadline, reminder and parent — and **show, hide or reorder those chips** to taste (separately for quick add and the full editor).

### Reminders
Attach one or more reminders to a task — either **relative** (“at time of task”, 10 min / 30 min / 1 h / 1 day before) or an **absolute** date & time. When a reminder is due, Harmony Tasks shows a **system notification** on desktop (even when Obsidian is in the background) and an in-app notice; clicking it opens the task.

> **Good to know:** in-app reminders fire while Obsidian is running (on desktop that includes the background; on mobile while the app is open). To be notified even when Obsidian is **fully closed**, turn on **Google Calendar sync** — reminders are pushed onto the calendar event, so your phone or OS notifies you.

### Notes, comments & attachments
Every task has a **Details** panel for the story behind the task:

- A free-form **Markdown description**.
- A **timestamped comment log** to track progress over time — add, edit and revisit notes, each stamped with its date and time.
- **Attachments** — click the paperclip, or simply **paste or drag & drop** files and images straight into a comment. They’re saved to your configurable attachments folder, and images appear as thumbnails with a built-in **lightbox** (zoom, copy to clipboard).
- **Link other notes** into a comment to connect related context from your vault.

Because it all lives in the task note’s own Markdown body, your comments and attachments stay readable and portable outside the plugin, too.

### Right-click anything
Every task row — in lists, on the board and in the calendar — has a **context menu** with the things you reach for most: set a date or priority in one click, add a reminder, move it to another project, area or the inbox, jump to its parent task, duplicate it, copy a deep link, open the note in Obsidian, or send it to the trash.

### Drag & drop
Drag a task onto a **project, area or the inbox** in the sidebar to move it there, or onto a **label** to add that label. On the board, drag between columns; in the calendar, drag onto a day.

### Everyday conveniences
- **Recolor & organize** projects, areas, labels and filters — set a color, convert a project ↔ area, hide, reorder or archive, all from the right-click menu or the Manage screen.
- **Duplicate** a task, **copy a deep link** (`obsidian://`) to it, or **print** a clean copy.
- **Soft delete** to Trash, then restore or empty it — nothing is lost by accident (Trash and Done are ordered newest-first).
- **Export & import all tasks as JSON** — a lossless backup of your task data (fields and description) that you can restore or move to another vault. Import from within the vault or from a file on disk; re-importing is **idempotent** (existing tasks are matched by id and skipped), and missing projects, areas and labels are recreated. Attachments and the comment log stay as separate files in your vault (back them up with the folder).
- **Import from TaskNotes** — migrate tasks from the TaskNotes plugin (non-destructive, idempotent), or import existing checkboxes from the Tasks/Lists format.
- **Order by hand** — switch sorting to *Manual* and drag rows by their handle or cards on the board. The order is stored in the notes and holds in every view.
- **Icons-only chips** for a more compact editor, and an optional **description preview** under task titles in lists.
- Localized in **10 languages**, mobile-friendly, and **popout-window compatible**.

## Installation

Harmony Tasks is not in the community plugin directory. Install it with **BRAT** — on desktop and on your phone alike:

1. In Obsidian open *Settings → Community plugins → Browse*, install and enable **BRAT**.
2. Open *Settings → BRAT → Add beta plugin*, enter `ladnlav/harmony-tasks` and confirm.
3. Enable **Harmony Tasks** under *Community plugins*. BRAT keeps it up to date from the GitHub releases.

Manual alternative: download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ladnlav/harmony-tasks/releases/latest) into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/harmony-tasks/` and reload Obsidian.

### Moving over from BeautyTasks

Harmony Tasks reads the same notes in the same folders, so your tasks, projects and filters are there right away. To take your settings along:

1. Disable BeautyTasks. **Never run both at once** — both would react to the same notes.
2. With Harmony Tasks disabled, copy `.obsidian/plugins/beautytasks/data.json` to `.obsidian/plugins/harmony-tasks/data.json`, then enable Harmony Tasks.
3. Hotkeys belong to the old plugin id — assign them again (the commands now start with “Harmony Tasks:”).

The Google Calendar connection, per-device state (collapsed sections, last page) and your Style Settings colors carry over by themselves. The default folders keep their `BeautyTasks/…` names for exactly this reason.

## Getting started

1. Install Harmony Tasks and enable it.
2. Click the **check-circle** ribbon icon (or run **“Open Harmony Tasks”**) to open the dashboard.
3. Hit **Add task** / run **Quick add**, type something like `Buy milk tomorrow #errands`, and press Enter.

That’s it — a new Markdown note is created for the task in your configured folder.

## How your data is stored

Every task is a Markdown note with frontmatter. Nothing proprietary:

```yaml
---
type: task
id: t-8f3a1
title: Write the launch blog post
status: todo            # todo | doing | done | cancelled
priority: high
due: 2026-07-10T09:00
scheduled: 2026-07-08
duration: 30            # minutes
project: "[[Website Relaunch]]"
section: s-k3j2         # section of the project (id from the project note's `sections`)
parent: "[[Draft the outline]]"
labels: [work, writing]
recurrence: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TU,TH
recur_basis: due        # due | done
reminders: ["-30m", "2026-07-10T08:00"]
created: 2026-07-04
description: Free-form text shown under the title
checklist:
  - "[x] Collect screenshots"
  - "[ ] Proofread"
---
```

Checklist items are plain strings with `[ ]` / `[x]` in front — keep the quotes when you edit
them by hand, YAML would read an unquoted `[ ]` as a list. A completed recurring task records its
successor in `next_instance: "[[…]]"`, so ticking the same occurrence twice never creates a second one.

The body is yours — Harmony Tasks keeps its own notes (comments, attachments) in a collapsible
`###### BeautyTasks Details-Logbuch` section at the bottom (the heading keeps the original plugin's name, so existing notes stay compatible) and leaves everything above it alone.

### Where the title comes from

Tasks keep their title in `title:`. If a note doesn't have that field, Harmony Tasks falls back,
in this order:

1. **`title:` in the frontmatter**
2. the **first level-1 heading** in the note
3. the **file name**

Renaming a task writes the new title back to wherever it came from, so the two never drift.
The file name is never changed — it is the note's identity, and links to projects and parent
tasks resolve through it.

That gives you one guarantee worth spelling out: **Harmony Tasks only writes into the body of a
note that already has a title there — a level-1 heading as its first heading.** If your note
starts with `## Something`, or has no heading at all, the title is stored as `title:` in the
frontmatter instead and your text is left alone. Notes with a structure of their own keep it.

**Turning a note into a task never touches its text.** The command only adds frontmatter: the
fields that make it a task, plus `title:` — taken from the note's level-1 heading, or its file
name if there is none. Whatever you wrote in the body stays exactly as it is, heading included.
Add a description in the task dialog if you want one, and use **Open task note** from the task's
context menu to jump back to it.

Upgrading from an earlier version? A one-time pass moves existing titles from the heading into
`title:`. It removes that heading line only in notes Harmony Tasks created itself — those live in
your tasks folder — and only when the line really was the title. Everything you wrote yourself
keeps its heading, and no task changes the title it displays.

### Field names

Two frontmatter fields carry Harmony Tasks' own meaning, and both are popular property names:

| Field | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | marks a note as a task, project, area or filter |
| `title` | holds the task title |

If you already use one of these names for something else, Settings → **Field names** points
Harmony Tasks at your own field instead, e.g. `bt_type`. Changing a name asks first and shows how
many notes it affects:

- **`type`** — your notes are rewritten to the new field and the old one is removed. Notes in
  excluded folders are never touched, and neither are foreign values: a note with `type: meeting`
  stays exactly as it is. Your own Dataview or Bases queries on the old field will find nothing
  afterwards, so adjust those yourself.
- **`title`** — existing titles always move over, so nothing can get lost. Whether the old field
  is removed afterwards is a checkbox, off by default: if `title` is yours, it stays exactly as it
  is.

### Project notes

Projects, areas and saved filters are Markdown notes too — and **their body belongs to you**. Harmony Tasks stores what it needs in the frontmatter and writes nothing into the text, so the note is a natural place for everything that belongs to that project: a brief, links, meeting notes, images.

Reach it from the **context menu** of the sidebar entry, or from the **⋯ menu** on the project page → **Open project note** (or area / filter note). It is worth opening: because every task points at it with `project: "[[Name]]"`, that note is already where Obsidian's backlinks and graph converge.

A **description** in the frontmatter is shown above the task list (switch it off under Settings → *Show description on project pages*) — the one-line answer to “what is this for”. Set it in the project's edit dialog; the long version goes in the body. The body is also what the **project overview** shows as *Info & links* — editing it there writes to this note, and only when you press *Save*.

**Sections** live in the project note's frontmatter, too. Tasks point at them by id (`section: s-k3j2`), so renaming a section touches no task:

```yaml
---
type: project
id: p-8f3a1
description: Everything for the September launch
color: "#4caf50"
sections:
  - id: s-k3j2
    name: Design
    description: Mockups and the UI kit
  - id: s-p9x1
    name: Wireframes
    parent: s-k3j2
---

Your own notes start right here.
```

A **subproject** names its parent with `parent: "[[Name]]"` — the same form subtasks use, so it is a real link (backlinks, graph) and follows renames. Only projects can be subprojects, and only one level deep; a link that would nest deeper is ignored and the project stays at the top.

The name always comes from the **file name**, never from the body or a `title:` field. That keeps one name for one thing: renaming the project renames the file, and Obsidian plus Harmony Tasks update every `[[link]]` pointing at it.

By default, notes live under these folders (all configurable in settings):

| Content | Default folder |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks | `BeautyTasks/Items` |
| Projects & Areas | `BeautyTasks/Projects` |
| Saved filters | `BeautyTasks/Filters` |
| Attachments | `BeautyTasks/Attachments` |

Projects and areas are the same kind of note (`type: project` / `type: area`), so they share one folder.

## Google Calendar sync

Harmony Tasks can mirror every task that has a **due date** into Google Calendar, two-way: the **date and time** flow in both directions, while everything else (title, duration, reminders) is driven by Obsidian. It uses **your own** Google API credentials — no third-party server is involved, and your token stays in your vault.

### Setup (one-time, ~5 min)

1. **Project** — open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create or pick a project.
2. **Enable the API** — go to *APIs & Services → Library*, search for **Google Calendar API**, and click **Enable**.
3. **Consent screen** — open *Google Auth Platform → Get started*: set an app name and your email, and choose **Audience = External**. Then open **Audience** and **Publish app** so the status is **In production**.
   > ⚠️ **Important:** In *Testing* mode, refresh tokens for calendar scopes expire after **7 days**, so the sync would break every week. *In production* they stay valid. You do **not** need Google to verify the app while you are the only user.
4. **Create the client** — go to *Clients → Create client*, set Application type to **Desktop app**, click **Create**, then copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
5. **Connect** — in Obsidian open *Settings → Harmony Tasks → Google Calendar*, paste the Client ID and secret, and click **Connect**. On the “Google hasn’t verified this app” screen choose **Advanced → Continue** — this is expected for a personal app.
6. **Calendar** — Harmony Tasks creates and selects a dedicated **“Harmony Tasks”** calendar (small blast radius; your other calendars are never touched). A **“BeautyTasks”** calendar from the original plugin is found and reused instead. Done.

The required permissions (`calendar.events`, `calendar.readonly`, `calendar.app.created`) are requested when you connect — there is nothing to pre-register in the consent screen. On **mobile**, step 5 uses a device-code login (you enter a short code on another device) instead of the desktop loopback flow.

### What syncs

| Field | Obsidian → Google | Google → Obsidian |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title | ✅ | — (Obsidian wins) |
| Date / time (`due`) | ✅ | ✅ written back |
| Duration | ✅ | — |
| Reminders | ✅ (as popups) | — |

- On a conflict (both sides changed the date), **Obsidian wins**.
- Existence is Obsidian-driven: an event deleted in Google is recreated as long as the task still has a date. To remove it for good, change the task in Obsidian or exclude its list.
- Exclude a project/area from sync via its right-click menu, the icon in the management list, or the edit dialog.

### Show your Google events

Separate from the sync, and read-only: switch on **Show events in Harmony Tasks** and your Google appointments appear in **Today** and **Upcoming**, next to the tasks due that day. Pick which calendars to show, hide events you declined, and set the text size. Nothing is written back and no note is created — an event never becomes a task.

Project, label and filter pages deliberately stay free of them: those are about your own work, not your day's appointments.

### Where credentials live

Your Client ID/secret are stored in `.obsidian/plugins/harmony-tasks/data.json` (git-ignored); if you sync your vault by other means (Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, iCloud…), this file travels with it. The OAuth token stays in the device's local storage, so every device connects once. **Disconnect** in settings revokes the token with Google and deletes it locally.

## On your phone

Harmony Tasks itself runs on Obsidian mobile — the views, the editor and quick capture all work there. What a plugin *cannot* do on iOS or Android is put a widget on your home screen or notify you while Obsidian is closed. That is an operating-system boundary, not something a plugin can work around: reminders only fire while Obsidian is open and in the foreground.

Two ways around it, depending on what you need:

- **Notifications** — turn on Google Calendar sync (above). Dated tasks become calendar events, and your phone's calendar app notifies you reliably, even with the screen off.
- **A real task app with widgets** — because every task is a plain Markdown note, other apps can read your vault directly. [TaskForge](https://taskforge.md) is one such app (third party, not affiliated, free with a paid tier).

### Setting up TaskForge

Everything below was tested on a real device against a copy of a real vault, in August 2026. It describes what actually happened, not what the documentation promises.

**In TaskForge:**

1. Point it at your vault and set the **tasks folder** — by default `BeautyTasks/Items`, or whatever you chose under *Settings → Folders*.
2. Set task identification to **by property → `type: task`**. Do not skip this: it is also what makes TaskForge *write* that property, so tasks you create on your phone show up in Harmony Tasks. Folder-only detection reads your tasks fine but creates ones Harmony Tasks cannot see.
3. Under field mapping, point **`dateCreated` at `created`**.

**In Harmony Tasks → Settings:**

4. **Field names → Labels:** set it to `tags`. TaskForge writes Obsidian's own tag field and cannot be remapped away from it, so this is the side that has to move. Your labels are stored as slugs already (lower case, no spaces), so they are valid tags as they are.
5. **Statuses:** TaskForge writes `status: open` for tasks it creates. Open the stored value of your own open status (the `</>` button next to it) and set it to `open`, so both sides mean the same thing.

| Creating tasks on your phone | They appear in Harmony Tasks. Without a project they land in the **Inbox**, which is where you want them |
| Editing existing tasks | Your project link, manual sort order and Google Calendar link survive untouched — TaskForge keeps properties it does not know |
| Recurring tasks | TaskForge rewrites the rule in iCalendar notation; Harmony Tasks reads that |

TaskForge also adds a few fields of its own (`taskSource`, `dateModified`). They are harmless — Harmony Tasks ignores them and leaves them alone.

### Two things worth knowing

**Your labels become real Obsidian tags.** That is the point of step 4, and it cuts both ways: every tag you put on a task note now counts as a Harmony Tasks label. If you use tags on task notes for something else, keep the label field at `labels` and accept that labels stay behind on the phone.

**“Repeat from completion” is ours alone.** A task set to repeat *after it is done* uses an extra field that the iCalendar standard has no concept for — Outlook and Todoist solve it the same way, outside the standard. TaskForge will show such a task as a plain repeat and cannot edit that part. The behaviour in Harmony Tasks is unaffected.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Open Harmony Tasks | Open the dashboard |
| Open Today / Upcoming / Recurring / Done | Jump straight to a view |
| New task | Open the full task editor |
| Quick add task | Fast natural-language capture |
| Turn current note into a task | Make the open note a task — adds frontmatter only, never touches your text |
| Search tasks | Fuzzy search |
| Count tasks | Show total / open count |
| Export tasks (JSON) | Save all tasks to a JSON file in your vault |
| Import tasks (JSON) | Restore tasks from a JSON export |
| Import from TaskNotes | Migrate tasks from the TaskNotes plugin |
| Import from Tasks/Lists | Migrate existing checkbox tasks |
| Sync with Google Calendar now | Run a calendar sync on demand |
| Show what’s new | Open the release highlights |
| Move titles to the frontmatter | Re-run the one-time title conversion (safe to repeat) |

Assign hotkeys to any of these under **Settings → Hotkeys**.

## Settings

- **Folders** for tasks, projects, filters and attachments — plus **excluded folders**, whose notes are never treated as tasks.
- **Field names** — which frontmatter fields Harmony Tasks uses for `type` and `title` (see above).
- **Language** — auto (follow Obsidian) or pick one of 10 languages (English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Turkish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese).
- **Start view** — which view opens by default (or the last used one).
- **Natural-language parsing** — toggle date/label/priority detection in titles.
- **Task actions (chips)** — show, hide and reorder the attribute chips, separately for quick add and the full editor.
- **Statuses** — add, rename, reorder, recolor and re-icon your workflow statuses.
- **Colors** — a muted or a colorful meta style, or set every accent yourself.
- **Text size** — scale task text, sidebar entries and headings independently.
- **Icons-only chips**, **description preview in lists**, the **description on project pages**, and the **overview on project pages**.
- **Google Calendar** — connect your account, choose the target calendar and sync options (see above).
- **Import & Export** — JSON backup/restore, plus import from TaskNotes or the Tasks/Lists format.

## Theming

Harmony Tasks is fully themeable through CSS custom properties. It ships with a built-in color palette (separate values for dark and light mode, defined on `.theme-dark` / `.theme-light`). Everything is overridable, so you can adapt it to any theme.

### 1. Style Settings plugin (color pickers, no CSS)

If you have the community plugin **Style Settings** installed, open its tab and you’ll find a **Harmony Tasks → Colors** section with color pickers for the semantic colors (overdue, due today, recurring, labels, priorities). These also drive the icon colors. Nothing is required in Harmony Tasks itself — without Style Settings the defaults simply apply. A **Monochrome (no colors)** toggle at the top renders everything in the text color and overrides the pickers.

### 2. A CSS snippet (full control)

Create a snippet under *Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets* and override any of the variables:

```css
body {
  --bt-overdue: #e05c4a;        /* overdue tasks & priority-1 ring */
  --bt-add:     #e05c4a;        /* the "+" of Add task / project / subtask */
  --bt-today:   #f97316;        /* tasks due today (also the Today sidebar icon) */
  --bt-recur:   #ec4899;        /* recurring (also the Recurring sidebar icon) */
  --bt-label:   #a855f7;        /* labels (also the Labels sidebar icon) */
  --bt-prio-1:  #ef4444;        /* priority 1 (highest) checkbox ring */
  --bt-prio-2:  #f59e0b;        /* priority 2 (high) */
  --bt-prio-3:  #3b82f6;        /* priority 3 (medium) */
  --bt-sched:   var(--text-muted);   /* deadline / scheduled chip */
  --bt-line:        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10);  /* section dividers */
  --bt-line-faint:  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);  /* task-row dividers */
}
```

Colors deliberately live in CSS variables (not in the plugin’s own settings) so themes, snippets and Style Settings can all drive them.

**Left sidebar icon colors** are themeable too. Each board has its own variable — `--bt-nav-search`, `--bt-nav-inbox`, `--bt-nav-heute`, `--bt-nav-demnaechst`, `--bt-nav-wiederkehrend`, `--bt-nav-erledigt`, `--bt-nav-manage` — and the item groups share one each: `--bt-nav-label`, `--bt-nav-area`, `--bt-nav-project`. For consistency, icons that also have a task chip default to the chip color (e.g. `--bt-nav-heute` → `--bt-today`).

### Per-project / per-area icon color

Individual projects, areas, labels and filters can have their own color. Pick one from the **color dot** in *Manage*, or from the **edit dialog** (right-click a sidebar entry → *Edit*). For projects and areas you can also set a `color:` property directly in the note’s frontmatter, e.g. `color: "#4caf50"`.

## Roadmap

Harmony Tasks is under active development, moving closer to Singularity.

Recently shipped: **subprojects**, **checklists**, **project sections**, the **project overview**, **flexible recurrence**, and recurring tasks that **carry their checklist and subtasks** into the next round.
